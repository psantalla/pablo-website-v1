                    <div class="st-col sp-ga--s">
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">In the realm of web design, the choice of tools is paramount. While traditional tools like Illustrator have long been the industry standard, the rise of Figma has challenged this dominance. This article delves into the reasons why Figma is superior to Illustrator for web design, exploring its unique features and advantages.</p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">At its core, Figma is a cloud-based design tool that enables seamless collaboration and real-time editing. This collaborative aspect sets it apart from Illustrator, which is primarily a single-user application. In the fast-paced world of web design, where multiple stakeholders are often involved, Figma's collaborative capabilities streamline the design process, allowing team members to contribute and iterate on designs simultaneously.</p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Another key advantage of Figma is its intuitive interface and user-friendly design. Unlike Illustrator, which can be overwhelming for beginners due to its complex toolset, Figma's interface is designed to be accessible and easy to navigate. This makes it an ideal tool for designers of all skill levels, enabling them to quickly learn and utilize its features to create high-quality web designs.</p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">Furthermore, Figma's extensive library of plugins and integrations further enhances its capabilities. These plugins provide designers with a wide range of additional features and functionalities, such as prototyping, icon libraries, and accessibility checkers. This level of customization and extensibility allows designers to tailor Figma to their specific needs and workflows, making it a truly versatile tool for web design.</p>
                        <p class="st-mw--pleasant t-s--m">In conclusion, Figma's collaborative nature, intuitive interface, and extensive plugin ecosystem make it the superior choice for web design over traditional tools like Illustrator. Its ability to facilitate seamless collaboration, provide a user-friendly experience, and offer a high degree of customization empowers designers to create exceptional web designs efficiently and effectively.</p>
