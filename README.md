Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio website! This is where I, Pablo, showcase my design and web development skills. Take a look around and let me give you a quick rundown of what you'll find here.

## Overview

This repository houses all the code and assets for my personal portfolio website. It's like my online playground, where I showcase my work, share insights on my blog, offer support services, and even provide some handy resources. 

## Features

- **Homepage**: You'll land on a cool homepage that highlights some awesome projects I've worked on for clients. Get a taste of my design and development wizardry right off the bat.

- **Blog**: I love sharing my thoughts and experiences, so I've got a dedicated blog section where I spill the beans on all things design and development. Stay tuned for some mind-blowing articles!

- **Dynamic Sections**: This website is always evolving because I'm a busy bee. Between my full-time gig as a designer and developer, and working on client projects, I'm constantly updating and adding new stuff to keep things fresh.

- **Support**: If you're in need of ongoing support, I've got you covered! Check out my support page to see the maintenance plans I offer. I'll keep your digital baby in tip-top shape.

- **Resources**: I'm building a treasure trove of resources just for you. Need some handy tools, templates, or guides? Swing by my resources section for a little pick-me-up. I add new goodies whenever I can.

- **Personal Touch**: While not everything on this site is strictly design or development, it's a peek into who I am and how I roll. You'll get a sense of my personality and work style. Cool, right?
